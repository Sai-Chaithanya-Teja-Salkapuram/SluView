Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Niki S.,"Des Moines, IA","Mar 25, 2024","Stopped by when in St Louis and got a Iced Vanilla Latte. This location feels more authentic then the other one in St Louis. I saw they did have some gluten free snack options. Parking was easy. Lots of people working on computers inside; however, Outdoor sitting/tables in the back patio area and few chairs in front. Fun relaxed vibe."

Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Kevin H.,"Saint Louis, MO","Jul 31, 2022","Here's the thing....St Louis has some awesome coffee shops/roasters. Blueprint stands a notch above all the rest however. Their location on Watson is my go spot. The service is fantastic, and the people who work their are incredible and friendly. Make sure and go hungry, and grab a sausage and pepper breakfast sandwhich!! Absolutely to die for! I love you Blueprint....so much."
Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Kayla H.,"Washington, DC","Aug 16, 2021","The vanilla latte I had was divine. Seriously, the best coffee I've had in St. Louis and some of the best ever. Definitely getting one for the road.The food was refreshing too. I gotta love a place where more than half the menu is vegan.  The cucumber sandwich hit the spot - hummus! Greens! Toasted bread! So. Good. The nut butter and spread that came with the today where very runny, but tasted good.Service was friendly and the team appeared to enjoy their job and each other's company, which is always a relief."
Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Megan S.,"Reno, NV","Nov 12, 2021","Order: Dirty Oat Milk Chai / Matcha Latte / Seasonal Cherry Pumpkin Tahini Latte / Black CoffeeSo good! I'm a happy semi-regular (budget allowing - it's not them, it's me).  The service is always amazing, drinks are bomb. Chai is made in house & has just a splash of sweetness, not overly so - it's so so good.The matcha lattes are also reeeeally beautifully made, sifting the tea into a really fine powder so it melts into the milk perfectlyThe seasonal pumpkin latte is outrageously yumAlways cool music, great outdoor patio & spacious inside with community tables. Masks requiredI love every bean roast I've tried andddd they have great swag. Soft shirts & I bought up all the mugs I could for myself & friends. So great!"
Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Sandra K.,"Houston, TX","Jun 4, 2022",Came here on a whim and it was a great place with the windows and everything completely open. Felt safe. The lattes were a little too creamy but still tasty. The breakfast biscuit sandwich was really good with a big block of strata as well as some sort of fig jam maybe. They were so nice to us and our dog and even have her a treat!

Blueprint Coffee,(108 reviews),Jason P.,"Saint Louis, MO","Jun 23, 2021","Anytime I evaluate a coffee shop, I usually rate the snootiness of the baristas. The more judgy the baristas seem, the more likely you are to have an outstanding cup of coffee. While Blueprint Coffee on Watson Road may seem like the type of coffee joint where you are scared of the baristas, you'll find that not only is the coffee incredible, but the employees are very pleasant and helpful!The coffee at Blueprint is always top notch. I like my coffee as pure as possible, so I can only comment on the black coffee and not lattes or other specialty drinks. While Blueprint offers many different types of beans, blends and roasts, you can always count on it having a big, bold flavor. It's a strong brew with loads of flavor. And to boot, the coffee is always well balanced and very approachable if you're someone who isn't used to craft coffee.I love to hit Blueprint anytime I'm in South City to grab a bag of beans to brew throughout the coming week. Two things to note about buying their beans. First, talk to the barista about how you brew your coffee at home and have them grind the coffee for you. I always feel so much better knowing that I have the correct coarseness of grind for my chemex at home. The second cool thing is that Blueprint offers you a free coffee drink of your choice with every purchase. But pro tip with the free coffee, you can ask them for a coupon for a free coffee during your next visit!"
