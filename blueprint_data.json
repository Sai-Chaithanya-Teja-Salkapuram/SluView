I gotta love a place where more than half the menu is vegan.  The cucumber sandwich hit the spot - hummus! Greens! Toasted bread! So. Good. The nut butter and spread that came with the today where very runny, but tasted good.Service was friendly and the team appeared to enjoy their job and each other's company, which is always a relief."

The service is always amazing, drinks are bomb. Chai is made in house & has just a splash of sweetness, not overly so - it's so so good.The matcha lattes are also reeeeally beautifully made, sifting the tea into a really fine powder so it melts into the milk perfectlyThe seasonal pumpkin latte is outrageously yumAlways cool music, great outdoor patio & spacious inside with community tables. Masks requiredI love every bean roast I've tried andddd they have great swag. Soft shirts & I bought up all the mugs I could for myself & friends. So great!"

While Blueprint Coffee on Watson Road may seem like the type of coffee joint where you are scared of the baristas, you'll find that not only is the coffee incredible, but the employees are very pleasant and helpful!The coffee at Blueprint is always top notch. I like my coffee as pure as possible, so I can only comment on the black coffee and not lattes or other specialty drinks. While Blueprint offers many different types of beans, blends and roasts, you can always count on it having a big, bold flavor. It's a strong brew with loads of flavor. And to boot, the coffee is always well balanced and very approachable if you're someone who isn't used to craft coffee.I love to hit Blueprint anytime I'm in South City to grab a bag of beans to brew throughout the coming week. Two things to note about buying their beans. First, talk to the barista about how you brew your coffee at home and have them grind the coffee for you. I always feel so much better knowing that I have the correct coarseness of grind for my chemex at home. The second cool thing is that Blueprint offers you a free coffee drink of your choice with every purchase. But pro tip with the free coffee, you can ask them for a coupon for a free coffee during your next visit!"
